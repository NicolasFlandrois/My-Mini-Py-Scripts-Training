# My-Mini-Py-Scripts
Mini python Scripts

In this repository I'll stack tiny scripts, command lines automation, small programs, practices, and exercices that are not part of a bigger projects,  or not big enough to have it's own project repository.

----------------------------
## TOOLS:

- **ask_integer.py**:

    create a fonction to verify if input number is integer and within range.

    *status*: Finished

- **pip_auto_update.py**:

    This tool will automatically check your python's pip list in your system, and update all packages to their newest versions.
    Then it will display a summary, with double checking points (number of packages before update compared to after update; and the number of packages that have been updated). Then it will display the list of updated packages: New Versions vs. Old versions.

    *status*: Finished

## Mini projects that moved to become a project of its own.

Those projects moved to their own repositories:

+ **Stardate Project**:

    - Generate (star trek) Stardate according to current time. Changing reference date.
    - Convert a date for input gregorian date (ISO-8601), to a stardate.
    - Translate a stardate input to a Gregorian date (ISO-8601).
    - This project has now an [independant GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NicolasFlandrois/stardate.git), and is no longer followed in this My-Mini-Python-Script Repo.

    *status*: Finished - v2

+ **Mayan Calendar Project** :

    - Generate of Mayan Long Count Calendar according to current time. Changing reference date.
    - Convert an input date (from gregorian ISO-8601 calendar) to Long Count.
    - Translate a Long Count Input, into a Gregorian date (ISO-8601 calendar).
    - Same 2 generator, convertor, translator, for Tzolkin and Ha'ab Mayan Calendar. Which is more difficult, as they are cycles, and don't refer to a year.
    - This project has now an [independant GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NicolasFlandrois/maya_date.git), and is no longer followed in this My-Mini-Python-Script Repo.

    *status*: Finished - v1

+ **Name Data Base Generator** (python + SQL):

    - The python generator will create random name association from lists of male names, female names and Family names, to generate a sql data base. Further more this kind of data base generator, can generate massive amount of data (names pairs). Such data base can be use to test software and scripts needing data. Such generator can be used for other objects than names.

    - Each entry containing:
        + ID SQL Key (autogenerated by SQL)
        + Family name (randomly paired with first name)
        + First name (randomly paired with family name)
        + Gender (M/F depending on first name randomly assigned)
        + Birth date (Random)
        + Socialsecurity number (According to gender + Year of birth + Month of birth + Randomly assigned department number in range or within a list + 8 random numbers) cf: [wiki page](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9ro_de_s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_sociale_en_France#ancrage_C)

    - This project has now an  [independant GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NicolasFlandrois/Populating-Database-Generator), and is no longer followed in this My-Mini-Python-Script Repo.

    *status*: **[Ice box - Waiting to work on it]**

- [Secret Santa](https://github.com/NicolasFlandrois/secret-santa) - MIT License - Copyright (c) 2020 Nicolas Flandrois

    This project has now an  [independant GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NicolasFlandrois/secret-santa), and is no longer followed in this My-Mini-Python-Script Repo.

    Regrouping the following scripts:

    + **secretsanta.py**:

        A mathematically proven way to randomly assign Secret Santa's to participants. Based on the Book of Dr Hannah Fry 'The indisputable existence of Santa Claus'.
        Give it the number of participants, it will give you a ready to print and cut document for Picking a pairing ticket (1 secret Santa & 1 gift receiving participant... Randomly assigned), in a [Santa's] Hat.
        Cut the Pairing Tickets, place them in a Hat.
        Each participants pick a ticket, with a Secret Santa ID number which they are, and to whom the'll secret santa gift offering this year.
        Display the Empty List. Each participant place their name in from of his Secret Santa ID.
        Leave the list to display, so participants can know to whom they will offer a secret santa gift this year.
        Random, Fair, Efficient!

        ~~***Possible Evolution***:~~

        ~~- Automate and randomize even further, by giving it a list of name. Reuse the random pairing algorythm. Send an email/sms to each secret santa, directly the name to whom they'll offer a secret santa gift. (Leaving No ways to reprint of reverse engineer it.)~~
        [cf. script file secretSantaEmail.py]

        *version*: v1

        *License*: MIT License - Copyright (c) 2019 Nicolas Flandrois

        *status*: Finished

    + **secretSantaEmail.py**:

        Based on previous `secretsanta.py` mini-project. Random automation Secret Santas assignements, and sending results individually by emails.

        *To Do (for next versions)*:
        - Create his own project REPO
        - Automate to Non Gmail Users
        - HTML Secret Santa text/body, to work on... add a Xmas-ish feel to it.
        - Import names/emails of Participating Santas from external file source (Data Base, or data file e.g. csv, txt, json).
        - Create a GUI, & combining both secret santa projects. Get a menu, either paper+hat (Suitable for office co-working annimation) or via email (totally automated).
